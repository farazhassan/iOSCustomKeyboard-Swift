Written in Objective-C and using storyboards and autolayout, this universal keyboard template is a complete starter kit for anyone looking to create a custom keyboard. All basic keys have been created, and the keyboard is switchable between number and symbol modes in the same manner as the system keyboard.

## Features

The following features are also implemented, with more to come:

* Universal design works on all devices, in all orientations
* Double tap SPACE key to automatically add a ". " at the end of a sentence
* Double tap SHIFT key to activate caps lock, triple tap reverts to no shift
* Keyboard letters change case when SHIFT key is activated
* SHIFT deactivates automatically (unless caps lock is on)
* Numbers and punctuation can be accessed by pressing '123', symbols can be accessed by pressing '#+='
* All keys functional, including DELETE, RETURN, and GLOBE keys
